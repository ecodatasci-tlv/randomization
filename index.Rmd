# What is randomization

---

# Make your randomization reproducible

```{r}
set.seed(20180313)
```

--

```{r}
snacks <- c("pretzels", "cookies", "popcorn", "bamba", "carrots")
sample(snacks, 3)
```

_If you use the same seed, you should be getting the same results as us!_

---
# Sampling with replacement

```{r error = TRUE}
sample(snacks, 10)
```

--

```{r}
sample(snacks, 10, replace = TRUE)
```

---

# Sample probabilities

```{r}
sample(snacks, 10, replace = TRUE,
       prob = c(.8, .05, .05, .05, .05))
```

# Shortcut: use an integer instead of a vector

# `?Distributions`
---

# Types of distributions

- **d**xxx - density/mass function
- **p**xxx - cumulative distribution function
- **q**xxx - quantile function
- **r**xxx - random generation

---

# Uniform distribution 

```{r}
tibble(x = runif(1000)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

---
# Normal distribution

```{r}
tibble(x = rnorm(1000)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

---
# Binomial distribution

```{r}
tibble(x = rbinom(1000, 1, prob = .7)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

# Null models
---

# What are null models
---
# How you construct them
---
# What to do/what to look out for
---
# Biases:

1. Narcissistic effect - incorporate the thing you are trying to test into your model
2. Jack Horner - you detect something that you should have taken into account but didn't

---
Example:
- pokemon dataset: t.test versus null model
- slight complication...pick and choose how you construct your model

Are blue pokemon more likely to have high attack ratings?
If 20% of pokemon are blue, you would randomly select 20% 1000x. Compare observed group to random groups

Are blue pokemon more likely to be water pokemon?
Weight sampling to make water more likely
---
# Take home

Null models are powerful but you have to be careful about how you construct them
You have to write them yourselves!

# Other stuff

- cross-validation & friends
